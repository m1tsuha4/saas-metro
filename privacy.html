  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 31 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    SaaS Metro Email Broadcast (“the App”) is developed and operated by <strong>Metro Software</strong>.
    This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our application
    and connect your Google Account (Gmail) to send email campaigns.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    When you authorize the App using your Google Account, we receive:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your Gmail address (for identification and sending messages).</li>
    <li>OAuth 2.0 access and refresh tokens issued by Google APIs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We <strong>do not</strong> read, store, or access the content of your Gmail inbox or any other Google data.
    The tokens are stored securely in our database and used only to send messages that you explicitly schedule or broadcast.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Use the Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate and send emails on your behalf via Gmail API.</li>
    <li>To log campaign status (sent/failed) for reporting purposes.</li>
    <li>To maintain reliable service and prevent abuse.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We never share, sell, or rent your data to third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    You may revoke access at any time in your
    <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      Google Account → Security → Third-party apps with account access
    </a>.
    When revoked, our system automatically invalidates your tokens.
    You may also request complete deletion of your account data by contacting us (see Section 8).
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    All connections to the App and our API servers use HTTPS.
    Stored tokens are encrypted at rest and accessible only to authorized backend services.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed toward children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. The latest version will always be available at this URL.
    Material changes will be communicated through the App or by email notice.
  </p>
